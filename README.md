# lbpcascade_face_recognizer

A simple python module for face detection and recognition.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3.x/2.7
Pymoon
opencv-python 4.x
opencv-contrib-python 4.x 
numpy
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
pip install pymoon opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```

## Running the tests

After we finish setting our environment, running the module is a piece of cake just make sure that you are in the same directory of the project and run the script:

```
python lbp_face_recognizer.py
```

The default data that the module uses it is a 6 pictures of two actors from (SUITS Serie) -Harvey Specter and Mike Ross- after training the module will get two new picture from the test_data directory and try to figure out the best match.

The result is as follows:
